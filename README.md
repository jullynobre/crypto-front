# Cypto Front

## Requirements
Unfortunately the backend used is not being able to handle CORS requests (visit the [Crypto-API project](https://github.com/jullynobre/crypto-api) for more detaisl). <br>
To be able to make requests on the front it is necessary to use Google Chrome and install the [Moesif Origin & CORS Changer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) extension and enable it to avoid CORS errors.
